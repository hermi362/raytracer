# raytracer
A C++ implementation of the simple raytracer from Jamis Buck's book "The Raytracer Challenge".

I am using this project to re-familiarize myself with C++ after being away for it for about a decade.

## Prerequisites
- g++
- gnu make

For the record I developed this in Debian 10 using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

AFAIK I don't use any features that are newer than C++11.

## Build instructions
Just run `make` in the shell. Execute `raytracer` to start program.
